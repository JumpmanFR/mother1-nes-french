-I didn't do anything plot-optional, without which the ending would still make sense (with a tiny exception for convenience inMagicant after save #... also I accepted some money in Reindeer.  Oops).  That means any item you have to go out of your way to get has not been acquired, and a player name has not been entered.

-Also, all inconvenient dungeon presents have been opened, while any you walk by many many times or can get with not that much walking has been left alone.

-As for *retaining* the stuff from said presents... I tried to treat this like a normal playthrough otherwise.  That means that while I didn't lose a Plastic/Cracked Bat at the Livehouse, I may have sold it or traded it for a fleabag.
